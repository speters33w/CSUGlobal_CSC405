## Module 4: Critical Thinking        

### Colored Cube

Familiarize yourself with the concepts of vertices, shaders,  buffers, and transformations in WebGL/OpenGL. Understand how vertices  define the shape of an object, shaders control the appearance, buffers  hold data, and transformations position and orient objects.

Create a WebGL/OpenGL Program that produces a Colored Cube.  Write the vertex and fragment shaders. The vertex shader should handle  the vertex positions and transformations, while the fragment shader  should define the colors.

Set up a render loop that continuously updates and redraws the  scene. Inside the loop, apply transformations, update uniform values,  and issue draw calls. Inside the render loop, issue draw calls to render the cube. Ensure the shaders are correctly receiving vertex and color  data.

Run the program and observe the colored cube on the screen.  Debug any issues that may arise, such as incorrect transformations or  shader errors.

Document the steps you took to create the colored cube. Explain the role of shaders, buffers, and transformations in achieving the  final result. Reflect on what you've learned through this exercise. This should be approximately 3 paragraphs in length.

**In your submission:**

- Include [screenshots](./images/) your working program
- Submit all the [source files](./) of your working program
- Submit a [Word document](./doc/Peters_Stephan_CSC405_CT4_Colored_Cube.docx) with the documentation and reflection
