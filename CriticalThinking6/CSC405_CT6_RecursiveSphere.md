## Module 6: Critical Thinking

### Approximating a Sphere Recursively

### Interactive Viewer

- This weekâ€™s discussion has provided an introduction to  Lightning and Shading, particularly with respect to reflection and  Vector Computations. In this assignment, you will briefly discuss a  sphere object (in one paragraph), which is used as an example curved  surface to illustrate shading calculations. Then use the code snippet  starting in [section 6.6](./doc/6.6_Approximation_of_a_Sphere_by_Recursive_Subdivision.pdf) to design an interactive approximated and  recursively subdivided sphere, using WebGL. Finally, complete a two  paragraph reflection on what you did and how it went.

  **In your program:**

  - Include [screenshots](./images) your working program
  - Submit all the [source files](./) of your working program
  - Submit a [Word document](./doc/Peters_Stephan_CSC405_CT6_Approximation_of_a_Sphere.docx) with your discussion and reflection (approximately 3 paragraphs)
